# Known Issues

* Playlist creation does not check if a playlist with the same name already exists. Spotify allows you to have unlimited(?) playists with the same name.
* Adding tracks to an existing playlist does not check if those tracks are already in the playlist.
* Commandline arguments do not work yet.
